# TwitterSentimentTimeSeries
This notebook scrapes tweets from a given twitter account and allows an individual to run some analysis on the information. Modifications of this notebook could help people to detect depression, track trends in politicians, monitor an account for prevention of sharing confidential information, and many other possible applications.

The results below where taken from checking Donald Trump's twitter account.The phrase we monitored was 'Fake', to measure how often he could refer to fake news. Each thin bar represents usage of the phrase in one tweet.
